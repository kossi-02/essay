                    I've been asking myself lately: "How come when we love someone, that person becomes the most beautiful thing that ever existed?"

                    I still remember back then, when I was putting effort into finding your flaws. It appeared to me that Destiny rhymes with Perfection. <br>
                    <br>
                    And I did find your flaws eventually. Some of them became my favorite things about you, some are just irritating lol. But if you love the rose, you don't care about the thorns.

                I am supposedly making this to tell you why I want to be with you.
                But the real question is " Who does not want to be with you Destiny ?"
                <br>
                <br>
                Some people have for motive your body. And I don't blame them. That body makes me lose my mind sometimes too. I mean... <br>
                I wish your cute little face was the first thing I see in the morning when I open my eyes to this evil and meaningless world.<br>
                I wish I was able to kiss those lips every time you smile as my mind suggests.<br>
                I wish I can cuddle those soft parts of your body to sleep at night. <br>
                I wish your voice be always here to calm my mind whenever it worries. <br>
                I wish these beautiful eyes of yours never see potential love in anybody else but me. <br>

                    (It has been a couple of days since I’ve started this project. I’m now questioning myself if I was not wasting my time, once again. Is “I heard you” the answer I am going to get ? Do you even like romance ? Aren’t you too hood for that ? Isn’t your heart too broken to believe everything I’ve been saying so far ? Am I even saying something different from all you have been hearing since men started approaching you? 

A lot of questions running through my mind right now. So I decided to shut it down and let my heart speaks. Even if I left you indifferent, at least I would say everything that have been buried deep down in the abyss of my heart.)

    <div class="container-fluid">
        <div class="row cover2">
            <div class="col col-sm-12">

                <p>
                    To finally answer the question, I wish my motives were more complicated or romantic but it is actually straightfoward. In one word it's my "Personality". <br>
                    Because I value grinding, I reject sloth women. Because I have a curious mind, I cannot tolerate women who are not knowledgeable. <br> 
                    Even if it is just for sex. And some people find me weird but it is what we say No to that define our identity. <br>
                    <br>
                    So when it comes to you, we both value the same things. You grind, you are smart even though you like to say otherwise. You are mature, You are a clean girl, You have respect for yourself. Your heart is pure. <br>
                    When you love somebody, it's more than physical. My situation was horrible when we met. I was a temp, no car, can't even speak english properly lol. All that meant nothing to you. <br>
                    So if that is not a good reason to choose you over and over again every single day then I failed as a human and as a man. As a human because I wouldn't value virtue, as a man because I would be attracted to h*es instead.

                (Today, you spent the entire day in TK again as you did yesterday. There is a strange paradoxe with me. The more I see you, the more I want to keep seeing you lol. <br>
                I ended up asking you for a facetime. We just hang up. The conversation was so smooth, I did not want it to end. We are clearly making progress, I'm proud of us.<br>
                And by the way,  your "um um" to say "No" is now part of things I like about you lol don't ask why I don't know lol.)

                   Here comes the end of this work, and it is the moment I was supposed to ask you if my arguments were convincing enough and if you want to be my girlfriend. <br>
                   But then, I started to ask myself if that is what I really want. Isn't <strong>"Girlfriend"</strong> just a title? <br> <br>
                   I then started inquiring the question and I found out that what I really want is You stop being confusing. By saying yes my mind will finally stop overthinking and will have peace of mind.<br>
                   But if you are still not behaving like a Girlfriend, I will start overthinking again, and it may even be worst. <br> <br>
                   What I'm actually craving for is intimacy. Be able to share our happiness and sorrow, be able to rely on each other, be able to get your back whenever someone talk you down on because you opened yourself to me and I can tell with assurance that "Nah bro you tripping, Destiny can never do that".
                   That is what I want for us.
